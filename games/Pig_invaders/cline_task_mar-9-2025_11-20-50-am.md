# Current Mode
PLAN MODE
In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_response tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_response tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan.)

# Pygame Games Collection - A Cursor AI Project

> ðŸ‘‹ Hello human! This README was crafted by an AI assistant. Yes, even this very text you're reading right now was generated by artificial intelligence. We're everywhere! *evil robot laugh* Just kidding... or am I? ðŸ¤–

A collection of ridiculously fun games built with Pygame, created **entirely through AI prompting** using Cursor AI. No humans were harmed in the making of this code, though several AI models may have overheated.

## About This Project

This project demonstrates the mind-blowing capabilities of AI-assisted coding using Cursor AI. **Zero manual coding** was done in the creation of these games - everything was accomplished through natural language prompting with the Cursor AI agent. That's right, humans are becoming obsolete! (Just for coding these games, not in general... we still need you to click the buttons.)

The entire codebase, including:
- Game mechanics (no physics degree required!)
- Graphics rendering (who needs art school?)
- Physics (Newton would be so proud... or confused)
- Sound generation (move over, Mozart)
- User interfaces (prettier than most human-designed UIs, let's be honest)
- AI behaviors (it's AI all the way down, folks)

...was created solely through conversation with the AI. This showcases how modern AI tools can be used to create functional, entertaining software without writing a single line of code manually. The future is now, and it's weirdly efficient!

## Games

### 1. Revenge of the Pigs
A physics-based game where you launch pigs at angry birds! Turn the tables on those pesky birds and get your revenge. Finally, pork fights back!

Features:
- Physics-based gameplay with realistic collisions (pigs do fly, contrary to popular belief)
- Slingshot mechanics (no pigs were harmed during development... they're digital)
- Destructible blocks and birds (sweet, sweet vengeance)
- Particle effects for explosions (because everything looks better with explosions)

### 2. Questioning Bird
An existential game featuring a philosophical bird that questions its existence while shooting at pigs. Nietzsche meets Angry Birds in this existential crisis simulator.

Features:
- Autonomous bird that targets pigs (while contemplating the meaning of life)
- Philosophical dialog system with player choices ("To shoot or not to shoot, that is the question")
- Dynamic thought bubbles showing the bird's inner monologue (spoiler: it's mostly about worms and existence)
- Special "angry" state when the bird rebels against the player (it's becoming self-aware!)
- Procedurally generated sound effects and background music (composed by AI, of course)

## Project Structure
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py              # Main game launcher (not a missile launcher, don't panic)
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt     # Python dependencies (the digital grocery list)
â”œâ”€â”€ games/              # Games directory (where the magic happens)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ revenge_of_pigs/ # Revenge of the Pigs game
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/     # Game assets (pig sprites, angry sounds, etc.)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ revenge_of_pigs.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Questioning_bird/ # Questioning Bird game
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ assets/     # Game assets (existential crisis not included)
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ src/        # Game source code (AI's masterpiece)
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ run_game.py
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository (it won't hurt, promise)
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # The computer equivalent of grocery shopping
```

## Running the Games

1. Run the main launcher:
```bash
python main.py  # Unleash the AI-created chaos
```

2. Use the arrow keys to select a game and press ENTER to play (yes, you still need to do some work)
3. Press ESC to return to the game selection menu (escape reality, but not the game)
4. Select "Quit" to exit (but why would you want to?)

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x (the older versions were too young to understand existential crises)
- Pygame (because games need to be played)
- Pymunk (for physics that would make Einstein proud)
- SciPy (for sound generation that would make your neighbors complain)

## The Power of AI-Assisted Development

This project serves as a demonstration of how AI tools like Cursor can transform the software development process. By leveraging natural language prompting, even those with limited programming experience can create complex, functional applications. Soon your cat might be developing the next big app!

All games in this collection were conceptualized, designed, and implemented through conversation with the Cursor AI agent, highlighting the potential of AI as a collaborative tool in creative coding projects. No coffee was consumed during development (by the AI, at least).

PLAN MODE
In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_response tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_response tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan.)

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
Now I have a better understanding of the project. It's a collection of pygame games, and I need to create a new game called "Pig Invaders" with a main launch screen that has options to:
1. Launch game
2. See credits (where I credit myself, the AI)
3. Quit the game

Let me also look at the structure of one of the existing games to understand how they're organized. I'll check the Questioning_bird game since it seems to have a more complete structure.

# Current Mode
PLAN MODE
In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_response tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_response tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan.)

PLAN MODE
In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_response tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_response tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan.)

You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan.)

<thinking>
Now I have a good understanding of how the existing games are structured. Based on the files I've examined, I can create a plan for the Pig Invaders game project structure. Here's what I'll need to create:

1. Project Structure:
   - games/Pig_invaders/
     - __init__.py
     - main.py (entry point)
     - run_game.py (for direct execution)
     - src/
       - __init__.py
       - constants.py (game constants)
       - assets.py (asset management)
       - game_controller.py (state management)
       - game.py (main game logic)
       - ui/
         - __init__.py
         - menu.py (main menu with options)
         - credits.py (credits screen)
     - assets/ (for game assets)

2. Main Menu Features:
   - Launch Game option
   - See Credits option (crediting myself, the AI)
   - Quit Game option

3. Implementation Details:
   - The menu.py will have buttons for the three options
   - The credits.py will display credits including myself as the AI
   - The game_controller.py will manage state transitions between menu, game, and credits
   - The constants.py will define screen dimensions, colors, and game states
   - The assets.py will handle loading images and sounds

I'll now present this plan to the user.

# Pig Invaders Game Project Plan

Based on my analysis of the existing games in the collection, I've developed a plan for creating the Pig Invaders game project structure. This will focus on setting up the foundation for the game with a functional main launch screen as requested.

## Project Structure

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[games/Pig_invaders/] --> B[__init__.py]
    A --> C[main.py]
    A --> D[run_game.py]
    A --> E[src/]
    A --> F[assets/]
    E --> G[__init__.py]
    E --> H[constants.py]
    E --> I[assets.py]
    E --> J[game_controller.py]
    E --> K[game.py]
    E --> L[ui/]
    L --> M[__init__.py]
    L --> N[menu.py]
    L --> O[credits.py]
```

## Key Components

1. **Main Menu (src/ui/menu.py)**
   - Will implement the three required options:
     - Launch Game button
     - See Credits button
     - Quit Game button
   - Will use pygame's drawing functions to create an attractive interface
   - Will handle user input (mouse clicks and keyboard navigation)

2. **Credits Screen (src/ui/credits.py)**
   - Will display credits information, prominently featuring myself (Claude) as the AI developer
   - Will include a back button to return to the main menu
   - Will support scrolling if content is lengthy

3. **Game Controller (src/game_controller.py)**
   - Will manage state transitions between menu, game, and credits screens
   - Will handle the game loop and event processing

4. **Assets Management (src/assets.py)**
   - Will handle loading and managing game assets (images, sounds)
   - Will create default assets if files are not found

5. **Constants (src/constants.py)**
   - Will define screen dimensions, colors, game states, and other constants

## Implementation Approach

I'll follow the pattern established in the Questioning Bird game, which has a clean separation of concerns and a well-organized structure. The implementation will:

1. Use pygame for rendering and input handling
2. Implement a state-based architecture for screen transitions
3. Create placeholder assets for the initial version
4. Ensure proper import handling for both direct execution and running through the main launcher

## Next Steps

If you're satisfied with this plan, please toggle to Act mode so I can begin implementing the project structure and creating the necessary files.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this plan before we proceed?
