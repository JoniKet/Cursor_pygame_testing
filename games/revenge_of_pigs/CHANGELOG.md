# Revenge of the Pigs - Development History

## Initial Development
- Created initial game structure with Pygame and Pymunk physics
- Implemented basic game mechanics including:
  - Slingshot launching mechanism
  - Physics-based collisions
  - Angry birds and wooden blocks
  - Score system

## Code Restructuring
- Refactored monolithic code into modular structure:

          ├── explosion.py
          └── victory_effect.py
  ```
- Created separate modules for each game component
- Moved constants to dedicated constants.py file
- Implemented proper import structure

## Victory Screen Implementation
- Added victory condition checking
- Created VictoryEffect class with particle effects
- Added victory screen with score display
- Implemented transition back to menu

## Menu and Instructions
- Added main menu with options:
  - Play
  - Level Editor
  - Credits
  - Quit
- Added game instructions in the main menu
- Improved instruction visibility with:
  - Increased font size
  - Dark blue background box
  - Blue border
  - Better positioning

## Bug Fixes and Improvements
- Fixed victory effect initialization issue
- Fixed collision detection between:
  - Pig and angry birds
  - Pig and wooden blocks
- Added proper collision handlers for both bird and wood block types
- Ensured physics bodies are properly added to space
- Removed debug print statements for cleaner console output

## Level Editor
- Implemented level editor functionality
- Added grid-based placement system
- Added buttons for:
  - Bird placement
  - Wood block placement
  - Clear level
  - Save level
  - Load level
  - Play level

## Controls and Instructions Update
- Added "R" key functionality to reset pig position
- Updated instructions to include:
  1. Click and drag the pig in the slingshot
  2. Release to launch
  3. Destroy all angry birds to win
  4. Wooden blocks can be destroyed with multiple hits
  5. Each destroyed bird is worth 1000 points
  6. Press 'R' to reset the pig to the slingshot

## Code Cleanup
- Removed original monolithic `revenge_of_pigs.py` file
- Kept utility scripts in assets folder:
  - `background.py` for background generation
  - `characters.py` for character sprite generation

## Current Features
- Physics-based gameplay
- Dynamic collision system
- Particle effects for explosions
- Victory celebration effects
- Level editor
- Score system
- Multiple block types:
  - Destructible angry birds
  - Damage-based wooden blocks
- Intuitive controls with reset functionality
- Clear instructions and menu system
