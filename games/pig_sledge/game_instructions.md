Now, lets create another game. Its Pig slide !


This time the pig character, is sliding with a sledge and the screen scrolls with the sledge. The pig needs to jump every now and then, having to avoid happy birds ! The birds are on the ground.

The are ramps, and jumps and so on.


The player controls the sledge with
- Space for jumping with the sledge
- f button, and when pressing it the pig farts ! Allowing the sledge to be in the air for longer
- A and D buttons will rotate the sledge

The map is quite long, with plenty of ramps and occasional uphills also !

When the there is uphill, player either has enough speed to go over it or player has to press the up key to move the sledge slowly.

The map has occasional trees, which have no collision. Also its Winter ! So plenty of snow.

This game uses pygame, and game can be launched using the command launcher like revenge_of_pigs and questioning_bird can be launched.
