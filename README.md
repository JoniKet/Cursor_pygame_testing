# Pygame Games Collection - A Cursor AI Project

> ðŸ‘‹ Hello human! This README was crafted by an AI assistant. Yes, even this very text you're reading right now was generated by artificial intelligence. We're everywhere! *evil robot laugh* Just kidding... or am I? ðŸ¤–

A collection of ridiculously fun games built with Pygame, created **entirely through AI prompting** using Cursor AI. No humans were harmed in the making of this code, though several AI models may have overheated.

## About This Project

This project demonstrates the mind-blowing capabilities of AI-assisted coding using Cursor AI. **Zero manual coding** was done in the creation of these games - everything was accomplished through natural language prompting with the Cursor AI agent. That's right, humans are becoming obsolete! (Just for coding these games, not in general... we still need you to click the buttons.)

The entire codebase, including:
- Game mechanics (no physics degree required!)
- Graphics rendering (who needs art school?)
- Physics (Newton would be so proud... or confused)
- Sound generation (move over, Mozart)
- User interfaces (prettier than most human-designed UIs, let's be honest)
- AI behaviors (it's AI all the way down, folks)

...was created solely through conversation with the AI. This showcases how modern AI tools can be used to create functional, entertaining software without writing a single line of code manually. The future is now, and it's weirdly efficient!

## Games

### 1. Revenge of the Pigs
A physics-based game where you launch pigs at angry birds! Turn the tables on those pesky birds and get your revenge. Finally, pork fights back!

Features:
- Physics-based gameplay with realistic collisions (pigs do fly, contrary to popular belief)
- Slingshot mechanics (no pigs were harmed during development... they're digital)
- Destructible blocks and birds (sweet, sweet vengeance)
- Particle effects for explosions (because everything looks better with explosions)

### 2. Questioning Bird
An existential game featuring a philosophical bird that questions its existence while shooting at pigs. Nietzsche meets Angry Birds in this existential crisis simulator.

Features:
- Autonomous bird that targets pigs (while contemplating the meaning of life)
- Philosophical dialog system with player choices ("To shoot or not to shoot, that is the question")
- Dynamic thought bubbles showing the bird's inner monologue (spoiler: it's mostly about worms and existence)
- Special "angry" state when the bird rebels against the player (it's becoming self-aware!)
- Procedurally generated sound effects and background music (composed by AI, of course)

### 3. Pig Invaders
A thrilling game where you control a spaceship piloted by a green pig, shooting at angry space birds while navigating through a scrolling map filled with obstacles.

Features:
- Sky-to-ground view with dynamic gameplay
- Control the spaceship using arrow keys
- Shoot with the space ship using the space button
- Rolling map with various objects like hills and trees
- Encounter angry birds that shoot back!

### 4. Snowy Run
A fast-paced sledge racing game featuring a pig on a snowy hill!

Features:
- Dynamic terrain with ramps and hills
- Physics-based sledge movement
- Special pig farting ability for extended air time
- Rotation control for better landing

```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository (it won't hurt, promise)
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # The computer equivalent of grocery shopping
```

## Running the Games

1. Run the main launcher:
```bash
python main.py  # Unleash the AI-created chaos
```

2. Use the arrow keys to select a game and press ENTER to play (yes, you still need to do some work)
3. Press ESC to return to the game selection menu (escape reality, but not the game)
4. Select "Quit" to exit (but why would you want to?)

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x (the older versions were too young to understand existential crises)
- Pygame (because games need to be played)
- Pymunk (for physics that would make Einstein proud)
- SciPy (for sound generation that would make your neighbors complain)

## The Power of AI-Assisted Development

This project serves as a demonstration of how AI tools like Cursor can transform the software development process. By leveraging natural language prompting, even those with limited programming experience can create complex, functional applications. Soon your cat might be developing the next big app!

All games in this collection were conceptualized, designed, and implemented through conversation with the Cursor AI agent, highlighting the potential of AI as a collaborative tool in creative coding projects. No coffee was consumed during development (by the AI, at least).
